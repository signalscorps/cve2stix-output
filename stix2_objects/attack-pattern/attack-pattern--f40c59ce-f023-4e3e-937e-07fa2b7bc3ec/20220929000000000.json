Passive techniques for operating system detection send no actual probes to a target, but monitor network or client-server communication between nodes in order to identify operating systems based on observed behavior as compared to a database of known signatures or values. While passive OS fingerprinting is not usually as reliable as active methods, it is generally better able to evade detection.", "external_references": [{"source_name": "capec", "url": "https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/313.html", "external_id": "CAPEC-313"}, {"source_name": "cwe", "url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html", "external_id": "CWE-200"}, {"source_name": "ATTACK", "description": "System Information Discovery", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1082", "external_id": "T1082"}, {"source_name": "reference_from_CAPEC", "description": "Stuart McClure, Joel Scambray, George Kurtz, Hacking Exposed: Network Security Secrets & Solutions (6th Edition), 2009, McGraw Hill", "external_id": "REF-33"}, {"source_name": "reference_from_CAPEC", "description": "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Information Processing Techniques Office, Information Sciences Institute University of Southern California, RFC793 - Transmission Control Protocol, 1981--09, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)", "url": "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc793.html", "external_id": "REF-128"}, {"source_name": "reference_from_CAPEC", "description": "Gordon \"Fyodor\" Lyon, Nmap Network Scanning: The Official Nmap Project Guide to Network Discovery and Security Scanning (3rd \"Zero Day\" Edition,), 2008, Insecure.com LLC", "external_id": "REF-212"}, {"source_name": "reference_from_CAPEC", "description": "Gordon \"Fyodor\" Lyon, The Art of Port Scanning (Volume: 7, Issue. 51), Phrack Magazine, 1997", "url": "http://phrack.org/issues/51/11.html", "external_id": "REF-130"}], "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--17d82bb2-eeeb-4898-bda5-3ddbcd2b799d"], "x_capec_abstraction": "Standard", "x_capec_child_of_refs": ["attack-pattern--76e6fe1e-34f2-40cd-8f12-f4d4f9c41808"], "x_capec_consequences": {"Access_Control": ["Hide Activities"], "Authorization": ["Hide Activities"], "Confidentiality": ["Read Data", "Hide Activities"]}, "x_capec_domains": ["Software"], "x_capec_likelihood_of_attack": "High", "x_capec_prerequisites": ["The ability to monitor network communications.Access to at least one host, and the privileges to interface with the network interface card."], "x_capec_resources_required": ["Any tool capable of monitoring network communications, like a packet sniffer (e.g., Wireshark)"], "x_capec_status": "Stable", "x_capec_typical_severity": "Low", "x_capec_version": "3.8"}
