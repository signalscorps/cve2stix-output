(This is also fixed in 5.3.8.12, 21.06.9, and 22.03.2 for LTS users.) Some Java application frameworks, including those used by Spring or Tomcat, allow the use of matrix parameters: these are URI parameters separated by semicolons. Through precise semicolon placement in a URI, it is possible to exploit this feature to avoid dotCMS's path-based XSS prevention (such as \"require login\" filters), and consequently access restricted resources. For example, an attacker could place a semicolon immediately before a / character that separates elements of a filesystem path. This could reveal file content that is ordinarily only visible to signed-in users. This issue can be chained with other exploit code to achieve XSS attacks against dotCMS.", "indicator_types": ["compromised"], "pattern": "[(software:cpe='cpe:2.3:a:dotcms:dotcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*' OR software:cpe='cpe:2.3:a:dotcms:dotcms:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*' OR software:cpe='cpe:2.3:a:dotcms:dotcms:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*' OR software:cpe='cpe:2.3:a:dotcms:dotcms:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*')]", "pattern_type": "stix", "pattern_version": "2.1", "valid_from": "2022-11-10T21:15:00Z", "external_references": [{"source_name": "cve2stix", "description": "This object was created using cve2stix from the Signals Corps.", "url": "https://github.com/signalscorps/cve2stix"}], "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--613f2e26-407d-48c7-9eca-b8e91df99dc9"], "extensions": {"extension-definition--b463c449-d022-48b7-b464-3e9c7ec5cf16": {"extension_type": "property-extension", "all_cpe23uris": ["cpe:2.3:a:dotcms:dotcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe:2.3:a:dotcms:dotcms:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"], "vulnerable_cpeid": ["cpe:2.3:a:dotcms:dotcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe:2.3:a:dotcms:dotcms:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"]}}}
