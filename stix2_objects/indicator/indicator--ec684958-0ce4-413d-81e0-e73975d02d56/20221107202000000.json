In affected versions the shovel and federation plugins perform URI obfuscation in their worker (link) state. The encryption key used to encrypt the URI was seeded with a predictable secret. This means that in case of certain exceptions related to Shovel and Federation plugins, reasonably easily deobfuscatable data could appear in the node log. Patched versions correctly use a cluster-wide secret for that purpose. This issue has been addressed and Patched versions: `3.10.2`, `3.9.18`, `3.8.32` are available. Users unable to upgrade should disable the Shovel and Federation plugins.", "indicator_types": ["compromised"], "pattern": "[(software:cpe='cpe:2.3:a:vmware:rabbitmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*' OR software:cpe='cpe:2.3:a:vmware:rabbitmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*' OR software:cpe='cpe:2.3:a:vmware:rabbitmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*')]", "pattern_type": "stix", "pattern_version": "2.1", "valid_from": "2022-10-06T18:16:00Z", "external_references": [{"source_name": "cve2stix", "description": "This object was created using cve2stix from the Signals Corps.", "url": "https://github.com/signalscorps/cve2stix"}], "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--613f2e26-407d-48c7-9eca-b8e91df99dc9"], "extensions": {"extension-definition--b463c449-d022-48b7-b464-3e9c7ec5cf16": {"extension_type": "property-extension", "all_cpe23uris": ["cpe:2.3:a:vmware:rabbitmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"], "vulnerable_cpeid": ["cpe:2.3:a:vmware:rabbitmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}}}
