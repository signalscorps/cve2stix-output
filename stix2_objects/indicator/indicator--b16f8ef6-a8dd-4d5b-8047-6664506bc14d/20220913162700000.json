    "description": "An injection vulnerability in the syslog-ng configuration wizard in Securonix Snypr 6.4 allows an application user with the \"Manage Ingesters\" permission to execute arbitrary code on remote ingesters by appending arbitrary text to text files that are executed by the system, such as users' crontab files. The patch for this was present in SNYPR version 6.4 Jun 2022 R3_[06170871], but may have been introduced sooner.",
