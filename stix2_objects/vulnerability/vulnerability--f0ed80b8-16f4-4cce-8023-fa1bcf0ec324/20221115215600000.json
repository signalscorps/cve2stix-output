This vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures against a Bleichenbacher attack on a device that uses SSL decryption policies. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS messages to an affected device, which would act as an oracle and allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform cryptanalytic operations that may allow decryption of previously captured TLS sessions to the affected device.", "external_references": [{"source_name": "cve", "external_id": "CVE-2022-20940"}, {"source_name": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-tls-bb-rCgtmY2", "url": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-tls-bb-rCgtmY2"}, {"source_name": "cve2stix", "description": "This object was created using cve2stix from the Signals Corps.", "url": "https://github.com/signalscorps/cve2stix"}], "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--613f2e26-407d-48c7-9eca-b8e91df99dc9"], "extensions": {"extension-definition--b2b5f2cd-49e6-4091-a0e0-c0bb71543e23": {"extension_type": "property-extension", "nvd_cve": {"data_type": "CVE", "data_format": "MITRE", "data_version": "4.0", "CVE_data_meta": {"ID": "CVE-2022-20940", "ASSIGNER": "psirt@cisco.com"}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": []}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-tls-bb-rCgtmY2", "name": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-tls-bb-rCgtmY2", "refsource": "MISC", "tags": []}]}, "description": {"description_data": [{"lang": "en", "value": "A vulnerability in the TLS handler of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.
