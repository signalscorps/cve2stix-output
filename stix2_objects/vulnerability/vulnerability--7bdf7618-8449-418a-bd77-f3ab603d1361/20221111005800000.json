    "description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. When using the forget password on the login page, a POST request is made to the `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email` URL. When the username or email does not exist, a JSON response contains a “user not found” message. This leaks information to unauthenticated users and introduces a security risk. This issue has been patched in 9.2.4 and backported to 8.5.15. There are no known workarounds.",
