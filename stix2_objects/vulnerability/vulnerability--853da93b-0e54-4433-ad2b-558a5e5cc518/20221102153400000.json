To exploit this, an actor would need to already be authorized on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, be able to create a public repository, and have a site administrator visit a specially crafted URL. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.6 and was fixed in versions 3.2.20, 3.3.15, 3.4.10, 3.5.7, 3.6.3.
