When a custom claim dialect with an XSS payload is configured in the identity provider basic claim configuration, that payload gets executed, if a user picks up that dialect's URI as the provisioning claim in the advanced claim configuration of the same Identity Provider. The attacker also needs to have privileges to log in to the management console, and to add and update identity provider configurations.",
